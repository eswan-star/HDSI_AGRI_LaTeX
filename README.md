# HDSI_AGRI_LaTeX

**Latex structure required for the HDSI Agri Datathon Write-Up as an extended abstract:**

An **extended abstract** is a concise summary of a research project or study that provides an overview of its objectives, data & methods, results, and conclusions. Typically longer than a standard abstract, it offers more detail while still being brief, often including key figures, tables, or references to support the presented information. The purpose is to give judges a clear understanding of your project and its significance, allowing them to assess its relevance to their interests or field.

## Instructions for Your Write-Up:

- **Work in the** `HDSI_AGRI_template.tex` **and** `references.bib` **files for your write-up.**
  - These files provide an example of text, several tables and equations, images that span both columns and span a single column, and a bibliography.
  - **Note:** Your write-up does not have to match this example. You are free to edit and reformat as you wish. 

- **Final Write-Up Requirements:**
  - Must have a **two-column format**.
  - Must be a **maximum of three pages**, including tables, images, and text (excluding references).

      5. **Conclusion**
  - The **Data & Methods** and **Results** sections should take up the majority of your three pages.

- **Required Files for Compilation:**
