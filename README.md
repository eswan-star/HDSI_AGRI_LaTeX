# HDSI_AGRI_LaTeX

**Latex structure required for the HDSI Agri Datathon Write-Up as an extended abstract:**

An **extended abstract** is a concise summary of a research project or study that provides an overview of its objectives, data & methods, results, and conclusions. Typically longer than a standard abstract, it offers more detail while still being brief, often including key figures, tables, or references to support the presented information. An extended abstract is typically used to submit your work for conference presentations. The purpose of this extended abstract is to give judges a clear understanding of your project, allowing them to assess your team's strategy to accomplish the selected prompt.

## Instructions for Your Write-Up:

- **Work in the** `HDSI_AGRI_template.tex` **and** `references.bib` **files for your write-up.**
  - These files provide an example of text, several tables and equations, images that span both columns and span a single column, and a bibliography.
  - **Note:** Your write-up does not have to match this example exactly by any means. You are free to edit and reformat as you wish. This is only supposed to be a 3-page example with references that was taken from an agriculture based project for Harvard's CS 283 Computer Vision course. It has no relevance to the competition prompts. No code should be included in the write up.

- **Final Write-Up Requirements:**
  - Must have a **two-column format**.
  - Must be a **maximum of three pages**, including tables, images, and text (excluding references).
  - Must include:
    - **Title**
    - **Team members' names and emails**
    - **Page numbers**
    - The following sections in order:
      1. **Abstract**
      2. **Introduction**
      3. **Data & Methods**
      4. **Results**
      5. **Conclusion**
  - The **Data & Methods** and **Results** sections should take up the majority of your three pages.

- **Required Files for Compilation:**
  - `exo-pic.sty`
  - `iccv_eso.sty`
  - `iccv.sty`
  
  **Note:** These files are necessary for formatting the `.tex` file. If they are not included, your `.tex` file will not compile. Learn more about these files [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Understanding_packages_and_class_files).

## Steps to Begin:

1. One member of the team needs to **download the contents of this GitHub repository** as a zip folder.
2. **Create a "New Project" on Overleaf** by uploading the zip file to their Overleaf account.
3. **Share the document** with other team members' Overleaf accounts to collaborate and work on the write-up simultaneously.
## Steps During:
4. Edit and reformat this `.tex` file as you wish and MAKE SURE to include your links to the YouTube Video and the Google Colab Notebook.
   - These links MUST be public or judges will not be able to view or validate your work.
5. Mentors will not help you debug your LaTeX code. We recommend you practice before the competition to become familiar with Overleaf and LaTeX.
  ## Steps When Complete:
6. Download the `.tex` file as a PDF once your team has completed the document. The PDF file name will be the Overleaf Project name. **Make sure PDF includes your team name.**
7. Submit the PDF (and the PDF only) to the **Submission Google Form** that is located on the website's Toolkit.
8. Congratulate yourself and your team members on participating and successfully completing Harvard's first HDSI Agriculture Datathon! 

## Important:

- **Any generative AI is not allowed** to be used for the write-up. Your team must write this content yourselves.
